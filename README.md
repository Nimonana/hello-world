# hello-world
Wow!! I was so interested in coding but life circumstances hit. I am now trying to get back into the groove of coding. My two kids are not 16 and 17 and I had a baby who is now 2. Time is of the essence but while going through it embrace all that you are facing whether good or bad. Godspeed!
